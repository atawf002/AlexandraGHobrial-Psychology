        <p class="lead mb-4">My major is psychology and I studied that because I love understanding what other people are like and how I can improve them to the better, and help them understand more about themselves. Psychology has helped me learn how to do research on the different types of people and what people are like. Research is very useful because it helps everyone to be more knowledgeable and understanding. Research can help many people with their lives to improve it to the better, if you take the application that you learn as an individual and apply it to your real life in the right way that can help you self-improve as a person.<br><br>

        Psychology is important for your everyday life, because it doesnâ€™t only help you understand the people around you, but also understand yourself more. This will help you understand what makes you happy and what you need in a work environment to be creative and productive in your work hours. Psychology can help you with communication to other people. Moreover, psychology is can help an individual with their motivation, leadership, emotional intelligence, decision making, and memory.I will use psychology to help the new graduate students to decide what job they see themselves in and what will make them happy. They should also be able to figure out what jobs suits their studies and what will help them improve from themselves. This program will take them step by step to learn more about what they like and what they can be creative and productive in. This will help each student to find what job they are passionate about and want to be in to live a happy and successful life.  <br><br>
